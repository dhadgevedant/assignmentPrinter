# Handwritten Assignment Generator

This project is a Python-based tool designed to convert typed text into a handwritten-style output, formatted for A4 paper. It is specifically developed to simulate realistic handwritten college assignments by introducing variability in letter size, tilt, spacing, and ink intensity.

The variation is necessary, but choosing the right handwritten font is what will make it look more realistic. I recommend using the Brio Slop font, which has a ballpoint pen writing style.
